musica
======

An music manager without GUI.

=====
You'd better use gcc4.7 or later.
The newest icc could be used in some places.
If you want to use tcc,don't use the c flag "-std=c99".
Never use clang.If you can make this project with clang,please tell us.
(Another choise is,if you want to use your default compiler,remove all "inline" in "musica.c".
